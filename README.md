# Ancestral-Informative-Learning-Curves
This is a script to estimate learning curves while balancing them at each iteration by a categorical confounder. 
In the original paper, we use these curves to balance by african american or european ancestry as we add subjects. 
This balancing provided an extimation of ancestral confounding across these two groups. for more see our
paper preprint here: https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.12.20193342v2

The script is annotated to help you engage in this method for youself.
